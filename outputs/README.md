The following output images and results have been generated by the Environmental Monitoring for Pollution Detection project.

1. Pollution Detection Outputs
Purpose: These images showcase the detected regions of pollution, specifically the oil spills and algal blooms, identified through image analysis techniques.
Characteristics:
Highlighted regions indicate areas classified as polluted based on color and texture analysis.
Binary masks and overlays are used to visually differentiate polluted regions from the rest of the water body.
Each output image includes a comparison between the original and processed versions to illustrate the detection process.

2. Types of Output Represented
Oil Spill Detection: Binary masks and overlays where dark patches (oil spills) are clearly identified.
Algal Bloom Detection: Detected areas with greenish-blue hues representing algal blooms are marked on the original image.

3. File Format and Size
Format: JPEG and PNG formats.
Resolution: Matches the input image size (typically 512x512 pixels).
Annotations: Output images include color-coded overlays to highlight detected pollution areas.

4. How to Interpret These Results
Pollution Masks: Binary images where white regions indicate detected pollution (oil spills or algal blooms).
Enhanced Images: Display the original image with detected pollution areas overlaid in red for easy identification.
Quantitative Metrics: Results include text annotations for pollution area coverage (in pixels) and Pollution Index values.
