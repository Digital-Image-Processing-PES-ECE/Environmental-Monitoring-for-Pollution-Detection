The following images have been uploaded for "Environmental Monitoring for Pollution Detection". 
These images serve as input data for the digital image processing techniques implemented in the project.

1. Aerial Imagery of Water Bodies
Purpose: These images are used to detect and quantify pollution levels such as oil spills and algal blooms in water bodies.
Characteristics:
Captured using aerial platforms like drones or satellites.
High-resolution images with diverse color patterns representing clear water and polluted regions.
Include variations in lighting and water conditions to test the robustness of the detection algorithms.

2. Types of Pollution Represented
Oil Spills: Dark patches with low saturation and high contrast compared to surrounding water.
Algal Blooms: Regions with greenish-blue hues indicating high concentrations of algae.

3. File Format and Size
Format: JPEG and PNG formats.
Resolution: Images are resized to 512x512 pixels for consistency and efficient processing.
Color Mode: RGB for color analysis, with grayscale conversions applied in the processing scripts.

5. How to Use These Images
Preprocessing: The images are preprocessed using resizing, grayscale conversion, and noise reduction techniques.
Segmentation: Used for testing color and texture-based segmentation to identify polluted regions.
Analysis: Ideal for evaluating the performance of algorithms like thresholding, edge detection, and filtering.

7. Sample Images Included
